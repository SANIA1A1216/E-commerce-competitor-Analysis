Product_name,Review
boAt Rockerz 255,"I am an earphone addict. I think I am eligible to write this review. I received it on 21 October and today is 29 October and the battery is still at 50%. I know it's crazyyyyyzzyy. I regret why I didn't bought it sooner. Doesn't have heavenly sound like 50k headphones but it's has Nuclear generated Battery. which you will need to charge only 4to5 times a month.Bike rideIt's not ideal for bike riding, it's for indoor use, alot of wind noise when riding, but no wind noise when plugged inside the helmet, additionally it makes alot of noise when you touch the earphone wire, the noise is not from the speaker btwbatteryBattery is great, no question about it. It's been 8 day's, I use it everyday and carry it everywhere and still it has 50% battery. after 8 days continuous used.Sound loudnessThe sound is loud I Don't recommend anyone to use it more than 80% level unless you want to lose your hearing within a year. 40% sound level satisfy me. It's too loud. If you put it more than 80% it's too dangerous for the eardrum.lastingI Don't expect to last it more than 1 year, like every boat earphone i have bought previously. ( they can last only 1 year maximum which is kind of disappointing.)  it's like boat earphone are built to last exactly 1 years. which makes you buy again and again. Which of course  makes sense. if they build a earphone that last forever. they won't be able to sell their newly launched product anymore.lookit looks good when you put it around the neck without listening. but when you put it in your ear it doesn't look cool ( around public) if you want to look cool this is not the right choice for you üòÅCan connect 2 blutooth device at the same timeBut the problem is, it can't recognise which is yours and which isn't, so when someone near you turn on their bluetooth, it will directly connect to it. which is kind of a minor problem. but i suppose boat apps can fixed it.sound qualitysound quality is kind of in the middle, I Don't have complains, but it's far better than 500 rs wired earphone IMO. the bass has high beat sound. mids and treble are perfect for me, bass is too much for me, IDK About your opinion.Noise block (ANC)If you play music to 30-40% sound level, you won't hear anyone talking near you. but if you Don't play any music, the noise level is blocked around 10% i would say. Considering this doesn't have any ANC it's great.i will update after 1,2,3 months used."
boAt Rockerz 255,"I‚Äôve been using the boAt Rockerz 255 ANC, and honestly, it‚Äôs a solid buy. The battery life is unbelievable‚Äî100 hours on a full charge! Plus, the quick charge feature is a lifesaver. Got just 10 minutes? You‚Äôll still get 24 hours of playback.The sound is bass-heavy and clear, perfect for music lovers. ANC works well for drowning out constant background noise, and calls are crystal clear thanks to the 3-mic setup.On the downside, the sound gets a bit distorted at higher volumes, and the wires feel a little fragile. But for this price, it‚Äôs packed with features and definitely worth it!Verdict: Great value for money, especially if you love long battery life and solid features. Highly recommended!"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound Quality and bass are nice as all other boat neckbands nothing special.But the battery backup, it's off the chart guys.If you are looking for a neckband that you want which lasts dor days or maybe in my condition weeks, you got the product here.I charged my boat neckband @100% . Used it nonstop for 13 hours and the battle was @ 80% athe the end of the day. Then on a straight base used it for 5days straightAnd the battery had still 45% left in it.I would recommend this to everyone who need long battery life with low budget.Worth it."
boAt Rockerz 255,"i like the design and quality  of the neckband. only i did not like the touch control it would be better if company provide buttons instead of touch control.sometimes they are not working as expected. only for the touch control i am giving 4 star out of 5 ratings.battery life is very good , i have been using this product since last 1 year its durable . sound quality is awesome. its very comfortable to wear and listen songs for long time"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Pros: durability, design, plastic quality, comfort, Battery.Cons: Uncomfortable while sleeping, app support, average sound quality, plastic design, magnetic strength is low.Review (boat rockerz 255 Z plus):  The one I recieved his magnetic on/off is not working I have filed for return, although I liked the design it's pretty light weight, looks modern and minimal, battery is excellent, seems durablebut the earbuds are pretty big in size I find it comfortable but not in case of sleeping it hurts the ear after long usage. The earbuds are made up of plastic which I don't like, found little difficult to use control buttons there is not gap between them to distinguish although symbols are there but people with fat little fingers have higher chances to press 2 buttons at a time.App support of  Boat Hearable is worst it's just for the name not like Realme Mobile App. Audio quality is average not very bad or very good. I am not a audio geek so can't tell in detail about treble or bass but the loudness of speakers are quite low. Even Local  Wired earphones provides more louder noice maybe because of maintaining audio quality. Mic is working fine as wanted. Although I bought it for 998 INR and finds it value for money product apart from malfunctioning of magnetic on/off hope they will bring new one working"
boAt Rockerz 255,"Melhor fone que j√° tive. N√£o cai devido ao suporte que fica no pesco√ßo, super confort√°vel, tem uma borracha que entra na orelha que ajuda o fone a ficar no lugar, bateria dura bastante e o carregamento e r√°pido. O som e √≥timo, microfone funciona bem. Vou comprar outro e deixar de reserva."
boAt Rockerz 255,"Fone bom, som alto limpo e com bons graves, veio com 80% de bateria e ainda n√£o descarregou, ou seja, dura mto a carga. Gostei e a entrega foi bem rapida."
boAt Rockerz 255,I specifically bought this to try this product and found that the middle button says adios amigo and nothing more no idea on how to fix it.It‚Äôs a shady product do not buy this product.
